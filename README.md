# react-native-relay

## What is it?
It's QnA app with login, register, askQuestion, and answerQuestion implemented. This project using react native and relay framework for graphql.
<br/>
<br/>
For back-end implementation, see: https://github.com/aeramu/go-graphql<br/>
Unfortunately, the server already down. But of course it can works in local with some adjustment.

## What I learned:
1. It's my first time using react-native (at least what i finished)
2. It's my first time graphql front-end too. And... Relay is so ducking **haaard**. I got error but i don't know what must i do. So much unnecessary error.
yeah, that was my noob. At least in the next project i found Apollo. Thanks for relay to give me hard time.
